### ðŸ“º What is Scuffle?

Scuffle is a live streaming platform that is built from the ground up. We are building a platform that is entirely open-source and transparent in our actions designed to be community driven.

We held a [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQpMRkzoVM&t=598s) in 2022 going over some of the features that we are aiming to build out this year.

### ðŸ‘€ Project status

We are currently in the process of building the platform! We are looking for contributors to help us and we are always open to new ideas.

We have a public [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ScuffleTV/projects/1/views/6) and [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/ScuffleTV/projects/1/views/1) where we update the statuses of the projects and tickets we are working on.

### ðŸ“– Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, you can reach out to us on our [Discord](https://scuffle.tv/discord) or create a [issue](https://github.com/ScuffleTV/scuffle/issues).

We are very friendly and we are more than happy to teach you and help you get started.

### ðŸ¦€ Our stack

Our stack is mostly Rust and we use Svelte for the frontend.

You can find the source-code for all of our services on our [monorepo](https://github.com/ScuffleTV/scuffle).
